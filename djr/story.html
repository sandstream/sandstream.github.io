            <span class="timeline-date">Early Years</span>
            <h3>Rust Belt Beginnings</h3>
            <p>Born in industrial Ohio. Dad worked at the auto plant. Started playing guitar at 14, first band at 16. The factory sounds became the rhythm in his blood.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="timeline-item">
            <span class="timeline-date">20s</span>
            <h3>The Dive Bar Circuit</h3>
            <p>Toured the Midwest bar scene for years. Never "made it big" but built a loyal following. His voice got raspy from smoky bars and late nights. The grind became his identity.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="timeline-item">
            <span class="timeline-date">Age 24</span>
            <h3>Beth</h3>
            <p>Met Beth Thompson at a show. She was a teacher. She believed in his music when no one else did. Married at 26. She kept him grounded. She was his home.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="timeline-item">
            <span class="timeline-date">Age 30</span>
            <h3>Emma & Jake</h3>
            <p>Emma born. Four years later, Jake. Diesel works too much. Misses dinners. Beth says "slow down." He doesn't hear her. Or maybe he just doesn't listen.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="timeline-item timeline-item-album">
            <span class="timeline-date">Album 1</span>
            <h3>HEAVY FUEL</h3>
            <div class="timeline-album-marker" style="border-left: 3px solid var(--color-album1);">
              <p><strong>The Power Era</strong></p>
              <p>Maximum power. Grinding til the wheels fall off. Every warning light flashing, but he's driving blind. Beth's voice in "Can't Take Much More" &mdash; he thinks it's about work. It's not.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="timeline-item">
            <span class="timeline-date">Two Years Later</span>
            <h3>The Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>Beth gets sick. Two years of hospital corridors. Emma is 7, Jake is 4. The mechanic who can fix anything &mdash; can't fix this. All those missed dinners. All that time he can't get back.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="timeline-item timeline-item-album">
            <span class="timeline-date">Album 2</span>
            <h3>SHATTERED</h3>
            <div class="timeline-album-marker" style="border-left: 3px solid var(--color-album2);">
              <p><strong>The Loss Era</strong></p>
              <p>Hospital lights. Empty chairs. The sound of kids asking when mommy's coming home. "Still Breathing" &mdash; not for him, for them. Beth dies at 40. Three chairs at the dinner table now.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="timeline-item">
            <span class="timeline-date">The Loss</span>
            <h3>Picking Up the Pieces</h3>
            <p>Beth dies at 40. Emma is 9, Jake is 6. The house feels wrong. Her chair empty. Her side of the bed cold. Diesel doesn't know how to be a single dad. But he has to learn.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="timeline-item">
            <span class="timeline-date">One Year After</span>
            <h3>Rebuilt</h3>
            <p>Home for dinner every night now. Makes breakfast for the kids. Learned to braid Emma's hair. Jake's nightmares are less frequent. Still hurts. Always will. But they're surviving. Together.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="timeline-item timeline-item-album">
            <span class="timeline-date">Album 3</span>
            <h3>BUILT BACK DIFFERENT</h3>
            <div class="timeline-album-marker" style="border-left: 3px solid var(--color-album3);">
              <p><strong>The Wisdom Era</strong></p>
              <p>Same engine, different fuel. The power is still there, but now it's for Emma and Jake. "Heavy Fuel Reprise" &mdash; same song, completely different meaning. Not built to last. Built back different.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="timeline-item">
            <span class="timeline-date">The Road Ahead</span>
            <h3>Keep the Engine Running</h3>
            <p>The motor still runs. Not for glory. Not for the grind. For them. Emma's growing up. Jake's getting stronger. The road goes on. And Diesel keeps driving &mdash; but now he knows what matters.</p>
