          <h2>WHAT IS THIS?</h2>
          <p><strong>Diesel Johnny Raines is not a real person.</strong></p>
          <p>He is an art project &mdash; a fictional artist created through collaboration between human creativity and AI tools. I wanted to explore whether it's possible to create genuine emotional resonance through a fictional story.</p>
          <p>The music is real. The emotions are real. The person is not.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2>WHY?</h2>
          <p>I've always been fascinated by storytelling. How music can carry a narrative. How a character can feel real even when we know they're fictional.</p>
          <p>With AI tools, I wanted to see if I could create an entire world &mdash; an artist with a history, a family, loss, and rebuilding. Three albums that tell one continuous story.</p>
          <p>Diesel isn't real. But the feelings in his music are.</p>

          "Art has always been about creating emotions through fiction. Shakespeare's Hamlet was invented. Springsteen's characters are often fictional. Diesel Johnny Raines is my version of that &mdash; with AI as collaborator."

          <h2>MY REFLECTION</h2>
          <p>This project taught me a lot about storytelling, about AI as a creative tool, and about the line between "real" and "created."</p>
          <p>Is Diesel's grief real? No, he doesn't exist.</p>
          <p>Can you still feel it? I hope so.</p>
          <p>Art has always been about creating emotions through fiction. The question isn't whether Diesel is real &mdash; it's whether his story moves you.</p>
